    return '''This is the take of team Unity-Feed on PRC:

Thesis:
Hope is the strongest antidote to radicalization. 

Without hope, peace is not possible.

The shift we are measuring: Can we make people more hopeful? 

Hypothesis: Yes, by displaying content that showcases unity and coexistence.

Prior evidence to suggest this: My friends and family who became jaded since the war broke out on 10/7 have said my Unity Club gives them hope. Other members in Unity Club have shared the same feedback. 

We will start with Palestine/Israelfocus and broaden it if we do notsee the variables shift.'''
